"# Weather-App"

Hello Guys !

This is an Node js + Express + handlebars based Weather application that fetches data from 2 different api's.

Here you can check the live weather updates of the whole world .

In this application i had used mapbox api to fetch latitude and longitude and then passes it to open weather api from where i get json based data of weather of that particular location.

Visit thit application at :
